# Smart-Vision-System
Project on Smart Vision System


Smart glasses for the visually impaired is an intuitive hardware plus software combined product which would serve as a helping or assistive device for the visually impaired people or the people who have visual disability. The idea is to design a product by keeping in mind the limitations it would present when being used by a person who us visually disabled.

The developed product will be able to assist the visually impaired people with everyday simple tasks and voice out all the results or the outputs of the processes, to curb this we employ the use text to speech. The idea is the create a product which would voice out the current date and time, voice out the current location, voice out the current weather information with the description, voice out the unread emails, voice out the current top 10 news headlines, voice out the text in an image by using OCR ( optical character recognition ) technology, voice out the dominant color in an image and also provide obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors hosted on the product. All these features would be available to the visually impaired person through the push of a button on the handheld remote corresponding to a particular feature. The processing and execution of the various features are performed the raspberry pi processor.
